	<h1>DATABASE AND JAVA WITH FOOD WASTAGE REDUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h1>
	<ol><h2><u><li>DATABASE</li>FOOD WASTAGE REDUCTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</u></h2>
		<p>Database name used: <b>.</b></p>
		<ul type="square"><h3><u><i><li>Tables</li></i></u></h3>

			<ol><li><b>food inventory table</b></li>

			<p>. Food Inventorytable in the project would involve creating a comprehensive food inventory system. This would include cataloging and tracking all food items, including quantities, expiration dates, and storage locations..</p></br>

			<li><b>storage location table</b></li>

			<p>Storage Location table would also incorporate a feature to document and manage the storage locations of food items. This would ensure that inventory is organized and easily accessible, reducing the likelihood of items expiring or becoming unusable due to poor storage.</p> </br>


			<li><b>waste events table</b></li>

			<p>on Waste Events table would track and record any instances of food wastage, including the reasons for the wastage and the specific food items involved. This would allow for analysis and identification of recurring issues.</p></br>

			<li><b>waste prevention measures table</b></li>

			<p>Waste Prevention Measures: Based on the data collected from waste events, the system would facilitate the implementation and tracking of waste prevention measures. This could include initiatives to reduce over-purchasing, improve storage practices, or optimize food usage in the kitchen.</p></br>

            <li><b>report table</b></li>

			<p>7 Report: The project would generate regular reports on food inventory, waste events, and the effectiveness of waste prevention measures. These reports would provide valuable insights for decision-making and planning future strategies.</p></br>

    <li><p><b><i>quantity:</i></b> The column tracks the number of each food item in stock.</br></p></li>

    <li><p><b><i>Password:</i></b> The inclusion of a password column seems unusual for a food inventory table typically a password column is not directly related to inventory management. however in management system it could be needed to secure the system.</br></p></li></ol>


                    <li><b>Attributes of Storage location table</b></li></br>

		<h2><u><li>JAVA PROGRAMMING</li></u></h2>
		
		<ul type="square"><h3><u><i><li>Description</li></i></u></h3>

			  <b>Introduction</b><br>
 <p>In this chapter I will be describing how powerful generalpurpose programming language was used to create the analyzed system. Under this chapter I will undergo full detail of how everything will function together with database that have been describe above and how it cope with full analyzed system.</p><br>
 
	<b>Tools used to develop this system in java programming</b><br>

<ol type="a"><li><p><b>Eclipse IDE:</b> an integrated development environment used in computer programming. It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It is the second-most-popular IDE for Java development, and was the most popular. </p><br></li>

<li><p><b>JAR stands for Java Archive:</b>  It's a file format based on the popular ZIP file format and is used for aggregating many files into one. Although JAR can be used as a general archiving tool, the primary motivation for its development was so that Java applets and their requisite components. </p><br></li></ol>






<p><b>MySQL Connectors:</b> MySQL provides standards-based drivers for JDBC, ODBC, and .Net enabling developers to build database applications in their language.</p><br>
